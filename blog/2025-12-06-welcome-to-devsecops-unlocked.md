## What You'll Find Here

### 📚 Comprehensive Cheat Sheets

We've created extensive command references for the tools you use every day:

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS CLI, Azure CLI, Google Cloud CLI
- **Container & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Version Control**: Git
- **System Administration**: Linux Shell Commands

Each cheat sheet is packed with practical examples and real-world use cases to help you work more efficiently.

### 🎯 Hands-On Guides

Our guides walk you through setting up complete lab environments, including:

- OWASP Juice Shop security testing labs
- Docker-based development environments
- Cloud infrastructure setups

### 🔐 Security-First Approach

DevSecOps isn't just about speed – it's about building security into every step of your development pipeline. Our content emphasizes:

- Secure coding practices
- Infrastructure as Code security
- Container security
- Cloud security best practices
- Identity and Access Management

## Why DevSecOps?

Traditional approaches separate development, security, and operations into silos. DevSecOps breaks down these barriers by:

1. **Shifting Security Left**: Integrating security early in the development process
2. **Automating Everything**: Using CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent, secure deployments
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Tracking security and performance in real-time
4. **Collaborative Culture**: Breaking down silos between teams

## What's Coming Next

We're continuously expanding our knowledge base with:

- Terraform and Infrastructure as Code guides
- CI/CD pipeline best practices
- Security automation tutorials
- Cloud architecture patterns
- Real-world project challenges
